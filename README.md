## ðŸ“‚ Projects & Highlights

### 1. Scalable Web Architecture with Terraform  
- Designed a **3-tier architecture** (Presentation, Application, Data) on AWS  
- Automated deployment via Terraform, used **spot instances** and dynamic scaling  
- Built web servers via user data scripts inside private/public subnets

### 2. CI/CD Pipelines for Containerized Apps  
- Created pipelines (Build â†’ Test â†’ Deploy) for a Python app  
- Integrated **ECR** + **Secrets Manager**, deployed on ECS Fargate  
- Added **zero-downtime deployments** and **automatic rollback logic**

### 3. Serverless URL Shortener  
- Built a serverless app using **AWS Lambda** + **API Gateway**  
- Uses JSON body POST on `/shorten`, generates short URLs, and persists in DynamoDB  
- Fully provisioned using Terraform, secure, and low maintenance

### 4. Automated Incident Response System  
- Monitors CloudWatch & EventBridge for suspicious IAM / API events  
- Triggers Lambda automatically to quarantine EC2 or disable IAM keys  
- Minimizes blast radius and accelerates reaction time in security incidents

### 5. SOC & Security Engineering  
- Led incident response and threat hunting using **Wazuh SIEM** + **ELK stack**  
- Automated IR workflows via Python & Ansible, reduced SOC response time by ~35%  
- Developed SOC processes, policies, and vulnerability management programs  
- Was part of the compliance team that achieved **ISO-27001** certification
